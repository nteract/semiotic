### All Frames

- _**string type**_: Creates an annotation using built-in SVG rendering. Supported types: `"label"` (default), `"callout"`, `"callout-circle"`, `"callout-rect"`, `"callout-custom"`, `"xy-threshold"`, `"bracket"`. Automatically transforms any properties on the annotation that match with your accessor functions.

```jsx
import { XYFrame } from "semiotic"

export default function() {
  return (
    <XYFrame
      annotations={[
        { type: "label", label: "a note", y: 100 },
        {
          type: "callout-circle",
          note: { label: "callout", title: "important" },

          //Will automatically map this to the
          //scaled Y value
          score: 10,
          subject: { radius: 30 }
        }
      ]}
      xAccessor={"week"}
      yAccessor={"score"}
      points={[{ week: 10, score: 20 }]}
    />
  )
}
```

- `enclose`, `enclose-rect`, `enclose-hull`: Takes an object with a `coordinates` property containing an array of data objects and encloses them with a circle, rectangle, or convex hull labeled with the passed label. For `NetworkFrame` this is not `coordinates` but rather an array named `ids` that has id values corresponding to the `nodeIDAccessor` setting. The annotation will also honor a `padding` prop that determines the space in pixels to pad the enclosure. Enclose-hull accepts a `strokeWidth` prop that determines the thickness of the hull stroking.

* `highlight`: redraws the mark but with the passed style function or object, this with the desaturation-layer below allow for easy highlight and cross-highlight behavior. See the [highlighting](/guides/highlighting) page for details.

* `desaturation-layer`: Creates a rect the size of the viz layer that has `fill: black` and `fillOpacity: 0.5`, you can pass a `style` prop to overwrite the default styling

- `frame-hover`: Creates a tooltip, which is a div centered on the datapoint populated with the values derived for that data point, you can use a separate prop `tooltipContent` to customize the value, see the [tooltips](/guides/tooltips) page for details.

### XYFrame

- `xy`: creates a circle, use `style` and `label` to customize
- `x`: creates an xy-threshold annotation along the x axis, you must pass a prop that matches the `xAccessor` used for the `XYFrame`
- `y`: creates an xy-threshold annotation along the y axis, you must pass a prop that matches the `yAccessor` used for the `XYFrame`
- `bounds`: Has a `bounds` property of format `[{left-x, top-y},{right-x, bottom-y}]` and will draw a rectangle around that bounding box. If any values are missing (x or y) in either of the bounds then it defaults to the full size of the viz along that measure.
- `line`: Has a `coordinates` array with objects in the data format of the frame and will connect the line in the order or the coordinates. If passed a label it places it between the first two points
- `area`: Has a `coordinates` array with objects in the data format of the frame and will draw an area with the coordinates in that array in the order passed, and add text with the a `label` prop positioned at the center of the polygon.
- `horizontal-points`: Takes a datapoint and renders an SVG circle for every datapoint in the dataset that falls along the same horizontal axis. The annotation can also have a `"threshold"` passed (defaults to 1) to determine the pixel tolerance for identifying other datapoints, an `"r"` prop that is a function that takes the point and returns a radius (default is () => 4) and a `"styleFn"` that passes the discovered datapoint and returns a JSX style object.
- `vertical-points`: Takes a datapoint and renders an SVG circle for every datapoint in the dataset that falls along the same vertical axis. The annotation can also have a `"threshold"` passed (defaults to 1) to determine the pixel tolerance for identifying other datapoints, an `"r"` prop that is a function that takes the point and returns a radius (default is () => 4) and a `"styleFn"` that passes the discovered datapoint and returns a JSX style object.

Example:

```jsx
const variousAnnotations = [
{ type: 'label', score: 4, attendance: 300, dx: -30, dy: 0, note: { title: 'Note at 4,300' }, subject: { text: 'A', radius: 12 } },
{ type: 'callout', score: 7, id: 'linedata-1', dx: 30, dy: -50, note: { title: 'linedata-1 at 7' }, subject: { text: 'C', radius: 12 } },
{ type: 'xy', score: 2, attendance: 2, label: 'Simply XY Annotation' },
{ type: 'x', score: 2, label: 'Simply X Threshold' },
{ type: 'y', y: 2, label: 'Simply Y Threshold' },
{ type: 'enclose', coordinates: [ {score: 3, attendance: 4}, {score: 5, attendance: 3} ], label: 'An enclosure' }
]

<XYFrame
annotations={variousAnnotations}
xAccessor="score"
yAccessor="attendance"
/>
```

### ORFrame

- `or`: a circle annotation with a `"label"` (like "xy" for XYFrame)
- `r`: an xy-threshold annotation at the r value

- `category`: A bracket annotation with the passed "title" and/or "label" based on the passed "categories" array (you pass an array of strings that correspond to the oAccessor category names and the bracket is drawn to surround them, which means it will encompass other columns if they are spread apart). Honors the following props:

  - `bracketType` = "curly" (draw a square or curly bracket)
  - `position` = projection === "vertical" ? "top" : "left" (whether to show the bracket on top, left, right or bottom)
  - `depth` = 30 (how deep the bracket goes into the viz)
  - `offset` = 0 (how far back from the viz the bracket is)
  - `padding` = 0 (the amount of pixels added to the edge of the bracket)

- `ordinal-line`: takes an array of `coordinates` and renders a line. Honors the following props:
  - `points`: (bool defaults to false) show points
  - `interactive`: (bool defaults to false) Points have an invisible 15px radius of interactivity as per standard hover annotation settings
  - `lineStyle`: a JSX style object for the line
  - `pointStyle`: a JSX style object or a function that takes a point and returns a JSX style object
  - `curve`: a d3-shape interpolator
  - `radius`: The radius of displayed points
- `column-hover`: Like `frame-hover` but the entire column/row is passed to the function.

### NetworkFrame

- `node`: Creates a callout-circle annotation centered on the node with an id corresponding to the "id" prop in the annotation
- `basic-node-label`: Places the "label" prop at the center of the node (label can be SVG JSX)
- `node`: Has an `id` value that corresponds to the idAccessor value of a node, and will draw a circle around that node with the label determined by the `label` value of the annotation object.
- `enclose`: Has an `ids` array with strings corresponding to values returned by the idAccessor value of nodes in this graph and will draw a minimum bounding circle around the nodes found with a label specified in the `label` value of the annotation object.

# Annotation Settings

In addition to creating annotations by passing them through the `annotations` prop, you can also use the `annotationSettings` prop to manage placement rules for automatic positioning.

- `type`: "bump" or "marginalia"
  - `"bump"` will use simple force collision rules to try to move annotations away from each other.
  - `"marginalia"` will put them into the margins, these settings are made possible by the [labella.js](http://twitter.github.io/labella.js/) library
- `orient`: "nearest" | "left" | "right" | "top" | "bottom" | `Array<of-those-strings>` Used in "marginalia" mode, determines whether the margin used to place the annotation should be nearest or, barring that, which margins are available (one or an array)
- `characterWidth`: defaults to 8, a way to express the font size since we're not using bounding boxes (so the size of the note is 8 \* the number of characters in pixels)
- `lineHeight`: defaults to 20 to determine the bounding box of the note
- `padding`: defaults to 1 in "bump" mode and creates additional space around an annotation
- `iterations`: defaults to 500 and determines the number of iterations of the force simulation (used only in bump)
- `pointSizeFunction`: defaults to () => 5 and determines the space around a datapoint that a bumped annotation avoids
- `labelSizeFunction`: defaults to a built-in function that tries to determine the bounding box of a label using the note's wrap property along with the above lineHeight and characterWidth
- `marginOffset`: used in "marginalia" and determines the additional padding away from the viz. Defaults to taking into account whether an axis is drawn on that side + 10 pixels (but you can only send a number)

# Custom Annotation Rules

You can send objects with any `type` value to the `annotations` array but if they don't correspond to any built-in types, they **won't** display.

You can write custom rules to handle new types or override the default behavior for built-in types.

Use `svgAnnotationRules` or `htmlAnnotationRules` depending on the type of JSX elements you want to create. Each of these functions is called on every item in the `annotations` array sent to the Frame. If `hoverAnnotation` is `true` Semiotic will append annotations on hover such as `frame-hover` or `column-hover` to the array of `annotations` each function is run against.

## Passed values

The custom rules expose the datapoint hovered, scales, and other properties of the frame.

- NetworkFrame: `d, i, networkFrameProps, networkFrameState, nodes, edges, voronoiHover, screenCoordinates, adjustedPosition, adjustedSize, annotationLayer`
- XYFrame: `d, i, xyFrameProps, xyFrameState, xScale, yScale, xAccessor, yAccessor, summaries, points, lines, voronoiHover, screenCoordinates, adjustedPosition, adjustedSize, annotationLayer`
- ORFrame: `d, i, orFrameProps, orFrameState, oScale, rScale, oAccessor, rAccessor, categories, voronoiHover, screenCoordinates, adjustedPosition, adjustedSize, annotationLayer`

## svgAnnotationRules { _function_ }

This function is run on every item in the annotation array, in addition to any hover annotations added by the Frame, it should return:

- an SVG element in JSX
- `null` if you want it to process all default types in addition to your custom rules
- return `false` if you only want to process your custom rules

```jsx
<XYFrame
  svgAnnotationRules={d => {
    // Catch annotation with type="r"
    if (d.d.type === "r") {
      return (
        <g
          fontSize="12"
          textAnchor="end"
          fontWeight="bold"
          fill={"pink"}
          transform={`translate(${d.adjustedSize[0] +
            d.orFrameProps.margin.left -
            20}, ${d.screenCoordinates[1]})`}
        >
          <line x2={-d.adjustedSize[0]} stroke={"pink"} />
          <text y={-5}>{d.d.note.title}</text>
        </g>
      )
    }

    // Continue to process all other annotations
    return null
  }}
/>
```

## htmlAnnotationRules { _function_ }

This function is run on every item in the annotation array, in addition to any hover annotations added by the Frame, it should return:

- an HTML element in JSX
- `null` if you want it to process all default types in addition to your custom rules
- return `false` if you only want to process your custom rules
